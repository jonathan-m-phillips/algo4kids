# Purpose of project
This project was created with my daughters and their friends in mind.
The purpose of Algorhythm 4 Kids is to create a fun enviornment for kids to learn basic Computer Science fundamentals.

# Intentions
- This project is to create a secure environment where parents need to create a parent account in order to create the individual child's account. Outside users will not be able to access a child's profile at all.
- Kids will be able to create a personalized avatar to keep them engaged and make them want to learn more. They will unlock more features and clothing for these avatars by completing courses and quizzes.

# Current features
- Parent can create parent account
- Parent can create up to two child accounts with JWT authentication
- Each child account can create an avatar and chooses 'styles' (we are just using enums for now with no style)
- Admin can create courses

# Implementation in progress
- Entire front-end styling of web app
- Allow children to take courses and quizzes
- Track grades to tell if child passed course or quiz
- Add a coin system for children to upgrade avatars
- Create different courses and quizzes per age group

# Future work
- Include animated avatars that dance and move
- Create mini games such as playing music to have avatars dance to using simple algorhythms
- Move to React Native for mobile application

# Languages, Frameworks, Database
- NodeJS
- ReactJS
- Redux
- ExpressJS
- MongoDB
- MERN Stack
- Axios
